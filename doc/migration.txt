eSciDoc infrastructure migration

This version of the eSciDocCoreAmin contains a tool to migrate eSciDoc infrastructure 
in version build 0.9.0159 to Release 1.0.

As a prerequisite you need Ant 1.7.0 to be installed.

In detail the tool does the following:
Step 1: Database migration
A new database containing the expected schemas and tables is created. The data from 
old escidoc database is read, changed to database format of Release 1.0 and then 
committed to the new database.

Please refer to readme.txt to see how database migration is invoked.

Step 2: Fedora repository migration  
As a precondition a newly installed Fedora 3.0b repository in directory fedora3.home 
is assumed. The tool first backups the folder fedora3.home/data/datastreams and copies 
the datatstreams folder from the existing Fedora 2 repository.
Afterwards the tool migrates all relevant foxml files from the existing Fedora 2 
repository to the new Fedora 3.0b repository.

Please refer to readme.txt to see how Fedora repository migration is invoked.

If step 1 and 2 have been executed successfully the Fedora 3.0b resource index and SQl 
database must be rebuild. To do that you have to call fedora-rebuild script located in 
fedora3.home/server/bin and follow the instructions. 
Please note if you have a large repository with a lot of objects in some cases the rebuild 
fails. If this happens please retry the last rebuild until it finishes with success.
